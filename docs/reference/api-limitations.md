# DaVinci Resolve Scripting API — Limitations & Feedback

<!-- GENERATED FILE — do not edit by hand.
     Source: src/utils/api_truth.py (entries tagged `submit`).
     Regenerate: venv/bin/python scripts/gen_api_limitations.py -->

This is a curated, behaviorally-verified list of DaVinci Resolve scripting
API gaps and bugs encountered while building this MCP server, intended for
submission to Blackmagic Design's developer feedback. Every item was
observed against live Resolve; each entry notes the current workaround (or
that none exists).

**Verified on:** DaVinci Resolve Studio 21.0.0

**Totals:** 6 missing capabilities, 9 bugs / unreliable behaviors.

The authoritative source is the runtime-queryable `api_truth` ledger
(`resolve_control api_truth "<query>"`); this document is generated from
it and stays in sync via a drift guard.

## Missing Capabilities (please add)

Functionality that exists in the Resolve UI but has no scripting API
equivalent, blocking full automation.

### Timeline.GetTimelineByName

- **Object:** `Project`
- **Behavior:** Does not exist. Timelines are looked up by index.
- **Workaround / current handling:** Iterate GetTimelineByIndex(1..GetTimelineCount()).
- **Tags:** missing-method, timeline

### Source Track Selector / destination track for Insert*IntoTimeline

- **Object:** `Timeline`
- **Behavior:** There is no API to read or set the Source/Auto Track Selector (the Edit-page patch panel that picks the destination track). InsertTitleIntoTimeline, InsertFusionTitleIntoTimeline, InsertGeneratorIntoTimeline, InsertFusionGeneratorIntoTimeline, InsertOFXGeneratorIntoTimeline and InsertFusionCompositionIntoTimeline take no trackIndex and always drop the clip on the selector's current target (V1 in practice). Locking lower video tracks does NOT redirect the insert — verified live on 21.0.0: locking V1 makes the insert FAIL rather than land on V2. Titles/generators also can't be moved afterward (no MediaPoolItem, so AppendToTimeline clipInfo and MoveClips don't apply).
- **Workaround / current handling:** Accept the limitation for titles/generators (insert lands on V1). For clips that DO have a MediaPoolItem, target a track with MediaPool.AppendToTimeline's clipInfo 'trackIndex' instead (exposed as media_pool append_to_timeline clip_infos). See issue #74.
- **Reference:** [issue #74](https://github.com/samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp/issues/74)
- **Tags:** missing-method, timeline, title, generator, track

### Per-clip audio channel-format conversion (Stereo<->Mono)

- **Object:** `MediaPoolItem / TimelineItem`
- **Behavior:** No scripting method converts an individual clip's audio channel format. ConvertTimelineToStereo is timeline-wide, and CreateStereoClip builds a 3D *visual* stereoscopic clip, not an audio mono->stereo change. The Edit-page 'Clip Attributes > Audio' channel mapping is UI-only.
- **Workaround / current handling:** Use the supported surface: timeline add_track with audioType (create mono/stereo tracks), get_track_sub_type (query format), convert_to_stereo (timeline-wide), and timeline_item get_source_audio_channel_mapping. Per-clip conversion is not possible. See issue #73.
- **Reference:** [issue #73](https://github.com/samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp/issues/73)
- **Tags:** missing-method, audio, channel

### Native multicam clip creation

- **Object:** `MediaPool`
- **Behavior:** There is no method to create a native multicam clip from a set of angles. Angles can be stacked onto tracks programmatically, but the multicam-clip conversion is a UI-only step.
- **Workaround / current handling:** Prepare a stacked timeline (media_pool setup_multicam_timeline) and finish the multicam-clip conversion in the Resolve UI.
- **Tags:** missing-method, media-pool, multicam

### Transition create / copy / clone

- **Object:** `Timeline / TimelineItem`
- **Behavior:** The scripting API exposes no method to add, read, copy, or clone an edit transition (cross-dissolve, etc.). Transitions applied in the UI are invisible to and unmodifiable by scripts.
- **Workaround / current handling:** Apply/duplicate transitions in the Resolve UI; no scripted equivalent exists.
- **Tags:** missing-method, timeline, transition

### Cloud project enumeration / export / user management

- **Object:** `ProjectManager`
- **Behavior:** Only CreateCloudProject, LoadCloudProject, ImportCloudProject and RestoreCloudProject exist. There is no GetCloudProjectList (list available cloud projects), no ExportToCloud, and no Add/RemoveUserToCloudProject — so cloud collaboration can't be fully automated.
- **Workaround / current handling:** Drive cloud project listing, export, and collaborator management from the Resolve UI; only create/load/import/restore are scriptable.
- **Tags:** missing-method, project, cloud

## Bugs / Unreliable Behavior (please fix)

Methods that exist but misbehave — silent failures, unreliable return
values, or automation-hostile modal prompts.

### MediaPool.AutoSyncAudio

- **Object:** `MediaPool`
- **Signature:** `(clips, settings) -> bool`
- **Behavior:** The boolean return does not reflect whether clips actually linked, and string enum keys in `settings` are silently rejected (the call returns False).
- **Workaround / current handling:** Resolve the AUDIO_SYNC_* enum constants via the live resolve handle, and verify by reading each clip's 'Synced Audio' property (see verify_by_readback).
- **Tags:** unreliable-return, silent-failure, audio, enum

### Timeline.CreateSubtitlesFromAudio

- **Object:** `Timeline`
- **Signature:** `(autoCaptionSettings) -> bool`
- **Behavior:** Same failure mode as AutoSyncAudio: the autoCaptionSettings dict is keyed by resolve.SUBTITLE_* enum constants with resolve.AUTO_CAPTION_* enum values, so plain string keys like {'language': 'korean'} are silently rejected (returns False, no subtitle track created). The boolean is also unreliable.
- **Workaround / current handling:** Resolve the SUBTITLE_*/AUTO_CAPTION_* constants via the live resolve handle (server._normalize_auto_caption_settings) and verify by reading the timeline's subtitle track count before/after (server._safe_create_subtitles).
- **Tags:** unreliable-return, silent-failure, subtitle, enum

### ProjectManager CloudProject family (Create/Load/Import/RestoreCloudProject)

- **Object:** `ProjectManager`
- **Signature:** `(..., cloudSettings) -> Project | bool`
- **Behavior:** All four take an enum-keyed {cloudSettings} dict (resolve.CLOUD_SETTING_* keys, resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_* sync-mode values). Plain string keys are silently rejected, so a settings dict built from human-readable keys yields no project / False.
- **Workaround / current handling:** Resolve the CLOUD_SETTING_*/CLOUD_SYNC_* constants via the live resolve handle (server._normalize_cloud_settings) before calling, and treat the bool return from Import/RestoreCloudProject as advisory.
- **Tags:** silent-failure, project, cloud, enum

### Timeline.Export

- **Object:** `Timeline`
- **Signature:** `(fileName, exportType, exportSubtype) -> bool`
- **Behavior:** exportType/exportSubtype must be resolve.EXPORT_* enum *values* resolved from the live handle. A JSON/MCP caller cannot pass a live enum, and a plain string ('fcpxml', or even the constant name 'EXPORT_FCPXML_1_10') is silently rejected with no file written.
- **Workaround / current handling:** Map a friendly format/subtype to the EXPORT_* constant and resolve it against the live handle (server._timeline_export_spec) before calling; verify the output file exists afterward.
- **Tags:** silent-failure, timeline, export, enum

### ProjectManager.DeleteProject

- **Object:** `ProjectManager`
- **Signature:** `(projectName) -> bool`
- **Behavior:** Returns False (no deletion) when the target project is, or recently was, the current project, and is flaky on the first attempt — so a single bool() call leaves the project undeleted with no useful error.
- **Workaround / current handling:** Load/close away from the target first, then retry; use src/utils/project_cleanup.py:delete_project_safely.
- **Tags:** unreliable-return, project, flaky

### Composition.Paste

- **Object:** `Fusion Composition`
- **Behavior:** Passing tool.SaveSettings()'s in-memory table to Paste() / LoadSettings() fails across the Python bridge with an OrderedDict/null-argument error and creates no node, while reporting nothing useful.
- **Workaround / current handling:** Duplicate via AddTool(RegID) + SaveSettings(path)/LoadSettings(path) through a temp .setting FILE, which round-trips reliably. Identify the new node by name diff.
- **Tags:** fusion, bridge, silent-failure

### FlowView.SetPos / FlowView.GetPosTable

- **Object:** `Fusion FlowView (comp.CurrentFrame.FlowView)`
- **Behavior:** Node positions are read/written through the FlowView, not the tool. SetPos returns nothing reliable; GetPosTable returns a 1-indexed table (or dict/tuple depending on bridge).
- **Workaround / current handling:** Use comp.CurrentFrame.FlowView.SetPos(tool, x, y); confirm with GetPosTable and a liberal position parser.
- **Tags:** fusion, unreliable-return

### MediaPoolItem.GetClipProperty('Transcription')

- **Object:** `MediaPoolItem`
- **Behavior:** Returns a PREVIEW of the transcription that ends in an ellipsis when the full transcript is longer than the property exposes.
- **Workaround / current handling:** Treat a trailing ellipsis as truncation (see media_pool_item get_transcription's `truncated` flag).
- **Tags:** transcription, truncation

### ProjectManager.CreateProject (with a dirty Untitled project)

- **Object:** `ProjectManager`
- **Behavior:** Returns None and pops a modal 'Save Current Project' dialog when the current unsaved/Untitled project blocks the switch. SaveProject() on an Untitled project re-triggers the same modal.
- **Workaround / current handling:** CloseProject(current) to discard the untitled project without a prompt, then CreateProject; restore with LoadProject afterward.
- **Tags:** project, modal, silent-failure
